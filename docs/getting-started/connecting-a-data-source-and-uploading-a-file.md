# 📂 Connecting a Data Source and Uploading a File

The next step in using DataDistillr is to connect data to your project.  This tutorial is only a brief overview of DataDistillr's data connection capabilities.  For complete documentation see the section on [_Connecting Data Sources to DataDistillr_](../connecting-data/connecting-your-data-to-datadistillr/)_._ &#x20;

### Creating a File Upload Data Source

After creating the project you will be taken to the _Data Sources_ screen in your new project. Click on the green _Add Data Source_ button as shown in the image below.&#x20;

Once you've done that you will see the data source type selection screen.  In this screen you can select the type of data source you wish to connect to your project.  As you can see, DataDistillr supports a wide range of data sources but for now, click on the _Upload Directory_ button, as shown below.  Click here to read more about [upload directory data sources](../connecting-data/connecting-your-data-to-datadistillr/uploading-files.md).

Congratulations!  You now have a file upload data source associated with your project.  You are ready to upload some data!

### Uploading Data

Now you are ready to upload data to DataDistillr.  For our tutorial, please download the two Excel files linked below.  Next, expand your file upload data source and you will see an area to upload your files. Simply drag your files there, and you should see the screen below.

If you added a file by accident, use the _X_ to the right of the file name to delete any files you do not wish to Upload. When your files are ready, press _Upload_, and you should see something that looks like the screen below:
