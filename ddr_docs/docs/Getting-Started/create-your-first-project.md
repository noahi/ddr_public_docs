# 🎬 Create Your First Project

DataDistillr is organized around the concept of projects.  You should think about projects in DataDistillr as, well... projects in real life.   DataDistillr projects are intended to serve as a container for all the pieces that go into creating value from data.  Within the context of a project, you can store datasets, queries, project notes, documentation, visualizations, and much more.  You can even chat with your colleagues in real time.&#x20;

But first, you'll have to create one.  To create your first project, simply click on the _Create Project_ button at the top of the screen.
